        <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and
        typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
        text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer <br />
        took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It
        has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
        typesetting, remaining essentially <br />
        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the <em>release</em> of
        <em>Letraset</em> sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
        recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus <br />
        PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
